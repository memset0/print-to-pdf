> For anyone who wants to develop Userscripts on [zhihu.com](https://zhihu.com) and some other websites, some methods to disable [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) may be required. For Chrome/Edge users, you can resolve this issue by installing this [Disable CSP](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/disable-content-security/ieelmcmcagommplceebfedjlakkhpden) plugin.

Run the commands:

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

This will open a web page and lead you to install the test script. After that, whenever you make changes to the code, the page will be automatically refreshed to load the latest compilation.
